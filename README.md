# Student_Life_multi_layer_perceptron
contribution to the Machine Learning Research Project on the dataset: student_life
Implementation of functions for the building and training model, clustering, and model evaluation

# Code backup (Functionalities):

#   Multi-Layer_Perceptron (MLP) for each group of students.
#   Clustering students
a) K-Means based on average stress
b) K-Means based on features from surveys
c) Clustering based on DTW on Time-Series data
#   Model Evaluation: 
a) K-Fold Cross Validation, Stratified by students, groups, student-id_stress-label, and group-id_stress_label
b) leave one out validation, subject to students and groups
